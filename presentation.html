      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I have a master's degree in international business with a specialty in marketing (ESCE business school, based in Paris). I studied twice abroad, in Russia and the USA.
      After my studies I moved to the Netherlands where I have been living for the past eight years. I have experience in online marketing, sales and recruitment. While gathering diverse professional experience and trying out different jobs, I have been looking for what I see myself doing in the long run. What came out of this, is that I want to do something creative. Upon research and a lot of thinking, I decided to take a big leap by quitting my job and applying for the Le Wagon bootcamp of January 2021.
      Following the 9 weeks of Le Wagon bootcamps, my love for front-end and my desire to "specialize" took over. Therefore I have decided to look for a job in front-end development.
